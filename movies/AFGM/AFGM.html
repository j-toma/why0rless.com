      <h1>Questions</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Where is the military base that is shown at the beginning of the movie?</li>
        <li>What is the name of the Marine Corps practice that killed Private Santiago?</li>
        <li>What is Kaffee eating when we walks into Joanne's office?</li>
        <li>What is Jessup's plan for Santiago after his meeting with Kendrick and Markinson?</li>
        <li>Where did Kaffee go to law school?</li>
        <li>What is the [Marine Corps] code?</li>
        <li>What color dress uniform do Kaffee and Sam wear in Cuba? Why was that a bad decision?</li>
        <li>At lunch, what does Jessup say happened in the meeting with Kendrick and Markinson?</li>
        <li>Kaffee learns that Kendrick ordered a Code Red in private and that Markinson has gone missing (Unauthorized Absence). He directly goes to Captain Jack Ross, who offers 2 years instead of 12 given the new information. Why doesn’t Dawson take the deal involving involuntary manslaughter?</li>
        <li>While Kaffee steps is talking to Luther (newspaper salesman) for the second time in the movie, someone sets him up for a surprise. What is the surprise? </li>
        <li>Kaffee goes to talk to Ross in a bar. What is the warning the Ross gives him? </li>
        <li>When Downey is on the stand, Jack Ross asks him about whether he really heard Kendrick order the Code Red. Downey had had an incident earlier that day preventing him from being in the room when the order was given. What happened that prevented Dawson from being back at the barracks when Kendrick gave the order to Dawson?</li>
        <li>Why can’t the defense put Markinson on the stand? </li>
      </ol>
