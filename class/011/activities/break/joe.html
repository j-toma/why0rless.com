  <p style="width:600px;">This picture was taken on the great Ocean road going toward Melbourne from the southwest. It shows my brother Sam looking out over the ocean to take a picture. He moved to Australia late last year and is struggling to get on his feet as an independent adult. He is an artist who has a great relationship with the manager of a gallery and he has been working in different jobs to support himself. I like this picture because the jacket he is wearing is one from my Grandma's old grocery store in Wisconsin. It is cool to think that this jacket would wind up on the other side of the world like this.<p>
