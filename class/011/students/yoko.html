  <p style="width:600px;">This picture is the dusk of Hong Kong’s night. I took it on Tism Sha Tsui’s department store. This is the eighth or ninth times that I travel to Hong Kong. My parents took me to Hong Kong when I was very young, so, I feel really comfortable and nice each time I go to Hong Kong. My families have taken vacation to there almost every year. I love it because of its modern style, its culture, its different atmosphere from inland of China. Since its history that it had been colonized by England, Hong Kong seems to be the combination of west and east.<p>
