  <p style="width:600px;">During this winter vacation, I went to Nepal with a group of students to do a psychology research about school bullying. We went to 2 different local schools, feel their culture, and met a lot of friends. I taught them Chinese dance and at last we performed together. I found that Nepalese are really earnest and enthusiasm and they will smile at you even you are just a stranger. This country involves many different religions and races and thatâ€™s why they are so kind and peaceful. This country really make me to feel like home and I hope that I can go back again in the future.<p>
