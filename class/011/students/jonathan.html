  <p style="width:600px;">This photo is in my grandma's downstairs.That day I went to see my grandmother.Quickly to the time, I see there is a Shared ofo bicycle in the corner.When I close to the bike when I found the bike did not have a seat.Shared a bicycle seat where?This is a serious problem.Later, I saw on TV news about the bike,Originally just seat will be removed, and were broken lock, be "stolen" bike, brake is "stolen".There are some bikes were locked with lock, and even into the water or on the tree.This reflects what problem?I think we are citizens of the comprehensive quality is not low, but many people still need to further improve, or my city will become malodorous.So we should start from the self, to protect our public facilities, improve the quality of our own<p>
