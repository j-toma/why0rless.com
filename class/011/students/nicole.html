  <p style="width:600px;">I went to a farm stay with my parent on vacation, and I met a sheep there, I think the sheep is very adorable and I'm curious about it. I’m afraid it at first, I started to get close to it. When I'm sure I'm not bitten by this sheep, then took this photo. It is a interesting thing that when I go far from this sheep, the sheep start to shouting , but it will stop when I come back. I put it in my ‘moment’ on WeChat, but the comment is very different with my image. My friends all comment that “oh the sheep is very similar to you” “I saw two sheep” and so on. So sad!!!!
