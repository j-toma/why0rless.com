  <p style="width:600px;">The picture illustrates the dog which i keeping. And it is filmed in Chinese new year, i love him very much (i love called him because i think he is my friend.). That day is he’s 9th birthday and the cloth is he’s new Christmas Dress. I want him wear in foreign new year (Christmas), but the shop forgot sent it, so we dressed him in Chinese new year and celebrate his birthday. And this is the first time i give him birthday gift. Why is that important for me? The reason is that he not only is my best friend but also a major family member in our family. In addition, he use his all life with us, however, the we just a quarter  times in our live if we can lived a hundred year and he can lived 25 year. So, in these short times, i am very cherish every second with him and every year he becomes old. And the special cloth which is his first time gets present.<p>
