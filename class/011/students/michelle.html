  <p style="width:600px;">This is a raccoon. I went to the wild animal park with my family in this winter vacation. And I saw it when he was ready to run. As far as I know, someone think it looks stupid but if you play with him or give him food that he like, he will running follow you also you will discover he is actually extremely cute and funny. In fact, I disapproved when to the zoo with them before, the main reason is I thought it is very naive. Now I do not think so, I believe I do a correct decision because I met a kind of animal that is uncommon to me.<p>
