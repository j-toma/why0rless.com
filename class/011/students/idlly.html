  <p style="width:600px;">I have traveled to Sri Lanka with my six friends in the nearest summer vacation. This picture was taken at that time. I think it is one of the most meaningful because it is recorded for the first time we bought and prepared food by ourselves. We went to the supermarket to bought food and cooked the dinner for two hours. The whole process actually spent four hours, we out of the door at 4 o'clock, and sit down to ate at about eight o'clock. This is the first Chinese food we had in Sri Lanka, although it is not really tasted good and without a good looking, but it must be delicious in our mind. <p>
