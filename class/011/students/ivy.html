  <p style="width:600px;">This picture was taken during the Spring Festival, I went to the countryside to enjoy my holiday, and I fund that there is a big hen in a nestï¼Œmy grandfather told me this hen was brooding and their babies was coming out soon. And I was so expected to meet these chicks. After about three days, the chicks were hatched. They are very cute and made me feel like a 'mother'. I think this is the best wishes from Spring Festival, also in this wonderful new year.<p>
