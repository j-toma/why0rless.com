          <h3>US tells companies not to overlook qualified Americans</h3>
          <div id="wapoH1BText" class="article-text">
            <p>WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has issued a stern warning to U.S. companies as they begin applying for coveted skilled-worker visas, cautioning that it would investigate and prosecute those who overlook qualified American workers for jobs.</p>
            <p>The message came on the opening day of applications for American employers seeking visas known as H-1B, which are used mostly by technology companies to bring in programmers and other specialized workers from other countries.</p>
            <p> “U.S. workers should not be placed in a disfavored status, and the department is wholeheartedly committed to investigating and vigorously prosecuting these claims,” Tom Wheeler, acting head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, said in a statement.</p>
            <p>The Obama administration sued companies for violating the Immigration and Nationality Act’s anti-discrimination provisions, including businesses that favored foreigners over U.S. workers. But Monday’s warning in a news release at the start of the visa process appeared to be a first-of-its kind signal to employers not to put American workers at a disadvantage.</p>
            <p>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services also announced that it would step up its reviews of employers that use H-1B visas, saying “too many American workers who are qualified, willing and deserving to work in these fields have been ignored or unfairly disadvantaged.”</p>
            <p>The statements were the latest indication that even legal immigration will be scrutinized under the Trump administration.</p>
            <p>While enforcement of visa abuses is not new, the aggressive position on the H-1B program is a different approach. White House spokesman Sean Spicer also addressed the issue at the beginning of his daily press briefing, saying the administration will crack down on businesses that discriminate against U.S. workers by using the visa program to hire foreigners.</p>
            <p>Yet, the crackdown comes as no surprise. President Donald Trump promised as a candidate for office to “end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program.” A draft proposal circulated in January promised to review existing regulations, find ways to allocate visas more efficiently and ensure that beneficiaries are “the best and the brightest.”</p>
            <p>Trump has yet to issue that order; the enforcement effort announced Monday could be an interim measure while a broader overhaul is worked out.</p>
            <p>The H-1B program is open to a broad range of occupations, including architects, professors and even fashion models. Companies must affirm that the job requires a specialty skill that cannot be filled by a U.S. worker, but critics say safeguards are weak. They argue the program routinely lets in foreign workers with minimal skills, even though these visas are supposed to be reserved for highly specialized jobs that are difficult to fill with U.S. workers.</p>
            <p>The tech industry insists the H1-B program is vital. Proponents say the program encourages students to stay in the U.S. after getting their degrees in high-tech specialties. He said many of them go on to start companies and hire U.S. workers.</p> <p>Critics called the announcement and increased enforcement a step toward reform.</p>
            <p> “While the laws/regs are chock full of major loopholes, the U.S. government hasn’t vigorously enforced them,” longtime critic Ron Hira, a Howard University professor, said in an email. “I suspect that many H-1B dependent firms are not complying with good faith recruiting promises. DHS investigations would help shed light on this.”</p>
            <p>The crackdown didn’t surprise the Computing Technology Industry Association, a trade group that represents Apple, Google, Microsoft and other major companies. Critics say that many of the available H-1B spots go to lower-paid foreign workers employed by consulting firms that let U.S. companies contract out their tech departments.</p>
            <p> “If it helps preserve the program and frees up more spots for truly exceptional people to continue innovation in this country, then it’s a good thing,” said Todd Thibodeaux, the association’s CEO. “And if it squeezes out people out at the bottom, then so be it.”</p>

          <h3>Trump donates salary to parks even as he tries to cut interior department</h3>
          <div id="nprParksText" class="article-text">
            <p>President Trump has donated his salary from his first few months in office to the National Park Service, making good on a campaign pledge to forego a presidential paycheck.</p>   <p>His gift represents a small fraction, however, of the money the Park Service stands to lose if Trump's budget were adopted.</p>
            <p>Instead of collecting a salary of $400,000 a year, Trump has volunteered to donate that money to charity. He chose the Park Service as the beneficiary of his first installment, $78,333, which covers the first ten weeks Trump was in office.</p>
            <p>Press secretary Sean Spicer delivered an oversized check for that amount to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke at the start of Monday's White House briefing. Spicer noted the gift had been approved by the White House counsel.</p>
            <p>"Ironically, it's not as easy to give money to the government as you would think," he said.</p>
            <p>Zinke was accompanied by Tyrone Brandyburg, the superintendent at Harpers Ferry National Historical Park in Harpers Ferry, W.V. Zinke says the president's gift will be earmarked for preservation of national battlefields.</p>
            <p>"These historic places tell the story of conflicts that helped shape our country's history, and they also honor the many men and women who have given their lives in service of this great nation," the secretary said in a <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-zinke-accepts-president-trumps-first-quarter-presidential-salary-donation" target="_blank">statement</a>. "I'm honored to help the president carry out his love and appreciation for our warriors and land."</p>
            <p>Zinke hinted, however, that the president's gift won't go very far.</p>
            <p>"We're about $229 million behind in deferred maintenance on our battlefields alone," he said.</p>
            <p>Trump is proposing deep cuts to the Interior Department, which includes the Park Service. The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/budget/fy2018/2018_blueprint.pdf" target="_blank">president's budget proposal</a> for the coming fiscal year would trim $1.5 billion or 12 percent from the department's budget. Ultimately, it's up to Congress to determine how much money the department can spend.</p>
            <p>Conservationists denounced Trump's donation as a "<a href="http://content.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2017/04/sierra-club-pans-trump-s-park-donation-publicity-stunt" target="_blank">publicity stunt</a>."</p>
            <p>"If Donald Trump is actually interested in helping our parks, he should stop trying to slash their budgets to historically low levels," said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. "America's parks, and the people and economies they support, need real funding, not a giant fake check. Parks are a good investment and we must invest now if we want them to be around for our kids," Brune added.</p>

          <h3>White House officials offer change to failed healthcare bill -- but is it enough?</h3>
          <div id="latHealthText" class="article-text">
            <p>White House officials made a new offer to conservative House Republicans late Monday on the GOP's failed healthcare bill, hoping to resuscitate a measure that crashed spectacularly less than two weeks ago.</p>
            <p>Vice President Mike Pence and two top White House officials made the offer in a closed-door meeting with members of the House Freedom Caucus, according to a participant. Opposition from the hard-line group, which has around three dozen conservative Republicans, contributed to circumstances that forced House Speaker Paul D. Ryan to withdraw the bill from a March 24 vote that would have produced a certain defeat.</p>
            <p>Under the White House offer, states would be allowed to apply for waivers from several coverage requirements that President Obama's 2010 healthcare law imposed on insurers.</p>
            <p>These include an Affordable Care Act provision prohibiting insurance companies from declining to write policies for people with serious diseases. Conservatives have argued that such requirements have the effect of inflating insurance costs.</p>
            <p>Freedom Caucus members said they wanted to see the White House offer in writing — which is expected Tuesday — before deciding whether to accept it.</p>
            <p>Also at Monday's meeting were White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and budget director Mick Mulvaney. The participant spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private strategy session.</p>
            <p>Another participant — Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows&nbsp;(R-N.C.) — said the group would make no decisions until it reviews the language but called the session a "good meeting" in a text message.</p>
            <p>But Meadows also said, "There is no deal in principle" at this time.</p>
            <p>It was unclear whether GOP moderates would accept the proposed changes. When Ryan&nbsp;(R-Wis.)&nbsp;pulled the legislation from the House last month, he also faced opposition from moderate GOP lawmakers upset that it went too far with cuts in Medicaid coverage for the poor and higher premiums for many low earners and people in their 50s and 60s.</p>
            <p>Rep. Tom MacArthur&nbsp;(R-N.J.), a leader of the moderate House Tuesday Group, was among moderate lawmakers who met with officials at the White House on Monday, a GOP aide said.</p>
            <p>The Freedom Caucus has drawn the most wrath from the White House for its opposition to the bill. Some fellow House Republicans have also criticized members of the conservative group, accusing them of inflexibility that led to the downfall of the bill to replace Obamacare,&nbsp;a top GOP legislative priority.</p>
            <p>Six days after the House bill crashed, Trump tweeted that the Freedom Caucus "will hurt the entire Republican agenda" if they don't start cooperating. He added, "We must fight them" in 2018, a reference to their reelection campaigns.</p>
            <p>Several caucus members, who tend to represent safely Republican districts, tweeted back defiantly. But some have stressed a desire to move the legislation along if provisions are added that they believe would contain insurance costs.</p>
