          <h3>Trump notches his 12th golf course visit</h3>
          <div id="cnnGolfText" class="article-text">
            <p>President Donald Trump headed to one of his golf courses again Sunday, marking his 13th visit to one since taking office and the eighth consecutive weekend he has spent at properties bearing his name.</p>
            <p>While the President hasn't played golf on every visit, sometimes attending to presidential business, the trips underscore a break with his insistence on the campaign trail that he wouldn't spend his time golfing because of how hard he would be working.</p>
            <p>White House officials told reporters that Trump held meetings at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, over the weekend, but did not say how many or with whom.</p>
            <p>Both Trump and his press secretary, Sean Spicer, have knocked former President Barack Obama for his time playing golf on the job. </p>
            <p>Trump's first visit to a golf course since becoming President was on February 4 at the Trump International Golf Club in Florida. His visits to that golf course as well as the Trump National Golf Course in Jupiter, Florida, have come during his trips to his Mar-a-Lago resort. </p>
            <p>He's also made several trips to the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, just outside of Washington.</p>
            <p>Trump owns several golf courses around the world and has worked out of some since the inauguration. He held a meeting with members of his Cabinet and senior staff at his Virginia golf course earlier this month and hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Mar-a-Lago during his February visit to the US.</p>
            <p>Spicer <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/19/politics/trump-golf-weekends/" target="_blank">has defended</a> Trump's golfing habit by citing the time he hosted the Japanese leader, arguing Trump utilized golf to "foster deeper relations."</p>
            <p>"How you use the game of golf is something that he has talked about," Spicer said.</p>
            <p>Trump's staffers have been <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/20/politics/donald-trump-golfing-presidency/" target="_blank">reluctant</a> to discuss his golf course trips, and many details of his games have instead come from posts on social media.</p>

          <h3>Trump head back to Florida to golf with Japanese PM Abe</h3>
          <div id="tbtAbeText" class="article-text"><p>WASHINGTON - President Trump can’t get enough of Florida.</p>
            <p>He is scheduled to return later this week to golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.</p>
            <p>First, Abe will meet with Trump in Washington on Friday.</p>
            <p>“He’s coming to the White House and then he’d like to play golf, and we’re going to come down to Florida, Palm Beach, and we’re going to play golf,” Trump said Sunday in an interview with Westwood One Sports Radio.&nbsp; “We’re going to have a round of golf, which is a great thing.&nbsp; That’s the one thing about golf -- you get to know somebody better on a golf course than you will over lunch."</p>
            <p>Trump spent the weekend at Mar-a-Lago, his first trip to the “winter White House” since the inauguration. He went golfing Saturday at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach.</p>
            <p>No telling if Trump will play with the <a href="http://www.golfdigest.com/story/donald-trump-receives-dollar3755-driver-from-japans-prime-minister">$3,700 driver Abe gifted him</a> after the election.</p>

          <h3>After golf with Trump, Paul says 'very optimistic' about ObamaCare repeal</h3>
          <div id="foxRandText" class="article-text">
            <p>Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a top conservative critic of House Republicans’ failed plan to replace ObamaCare, concluded his golf outing Sunday with President Trump by saying party members are “getting closer” on a compromise repeal plan and that he remains “very optimistic.”</p>
            <p>The president’s invitation for Paul to play at Trump National Golf Club is a sign that he is trying again to negotiate with congressional conservatives who failed to back the originial ObamaCare overhaul plan, after weeks of attacking them.</p>
            <p>“We had a great day with the president,” Paul said after playing with Trump and White House Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney at the northern Virgina club. “We did talk about some health care reform. I think the sides are getting closer and closer together. And I remain very optimistic that we will get an ObamaCare repeal.”</p>
            <p>Paul, an eye doctor and Tea Party favorite, has his own ObamaCare replacement plan, which he argues goes further than the Republican House leadership plan to fully repeal and replace the 2010 health care law, under which consumers are facing rising costs and fewer policy options.</p>
            <p>White House official Stephanie Grisham said earlier Sunday that the threesome would discussing several issues at the club but that health care would be “a big topic.”</p>
            <p>Mulvaney is a founding member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, which led the opposition to the Republican overhaul plan that failed last month in the GOP-controlled House.</p>
            <p>Trump has been critical of the Freedom Caucus and the majority of its roughly 35 members who were influential in stopping a vote on House overhaul plan.</p>
            <p>Trump warned caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., in a closed-door Capitol Hill meeting about not supporting the overhaul plan, saying, “Oh Mark, I'm coming after you.”</p>
            <p>And in just the past few days, the president and the White House have singled out the Freedom Caucus and specific members for their non-support -- including Michigan GOP Rep. Justin Amash and South Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Sanford, who is sponsoring the House version of Paul’s overhaul plan.</p>
            <p>On Thursday, Trump tweeted: “The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, &amp; fast. We must fight them, &amp; Dems, in 2018!”</p>
            <p>Also that day, The Post and Courier newspaper in South Carolina reported that Trump dared Sanford to vote against the overhaul bill.</p>
            <p>Sanford said that Mulvaney told him: "The president asked me to look you square in the eyes and to say that he hoped that you voted ‘no’ on this bill so he could run (a primary challenger) against you in 2018."&nbsp;</p>
            <p>On Saturday, White House social media Director Dan Scavino Jr. tweeted: “Donald Trump is bringing auto plants &amp; jobs back to Michigan. @justinamash is a big liability. #TrumpTrain, defeat him in primary.”</p>
            <p>Trump in recent days has also expressed a desire to revisit repealing and replacing ObamaCare, one of his major campaign promises.</p>
            <p>“Talks on Repealing and Replacing ObamaCare are, and have been, going on, and will continue until such time as a deal is hopefully struck,” he tweeted Sunday before the golf outing.</p>
            <p>Trump invited Meadows and Texas GOP Sen. Mike Lee, another influential Capitol Hill conservative, to his Florida resort Mar-a-Lago the weekend before the scrapped House vote in an effort to win their support.&nbsp;</p>
